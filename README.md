## StudentCourseManager-LuannePlemmons

A **Python-based Student Grade Management System** implemented in **OOP style**.  
This project follows the **Waterfall Software Development Process Model** and demonstrates how students can be managed with enrollments, courses, grades, GPA calculation, and data persistence through the use of the file students.json.  

===============================

## Features
- Add and remove students  
- Enroll a student in one or more courses  
- Remove a course from a student  
- Assign grades per course  
- Calculate **average grade per course (per student)**  
- Calculate **overall GPA across all courses**  
- Display student details and all students  
- Save and load data from JSON for persistence  


===============================

## Process Model: Waterfall

This project was developed in **sequential stages**:

1. **Requirements** → Documented in `/waterfall/docs/requirements.md`  
2. **Design** → UML-style class design (Student, Course, GradeManager)  
3. **Implementation** → Python OOP code (`grade_manager.py`)  
4. **Testing** → Functional test results in `/waterfall/test_report.txt`  
5. **Deployment/Delivery** → Final organized repo submission  

Each stage is committed with meaningful messages to reflect Waterfall’s linear flow.
