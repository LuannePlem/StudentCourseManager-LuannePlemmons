## Reflection between Waterfall vs Agile
**Waterfall**  
- Feels more practical when the project has very clear requirements that are unlikely to change.
- Working in a regulated environment when documentation is mandatory.
- Client requires step-by-step, linear process with heavy upfront planning.
- Little iteration was technically required with this project. However, when issues were found within the code, trying to fix and debug code was much harder since there was more code to work with.  
In conclusion: Waterfall feels more practical for predictable systems with a fixed scope and exact, unchanging requirements.

**Agile**
- Best used when requirements are uncertain, evolving, or client-driven.
- Quick value delivery and refined based on feedback. This ensures clients don't feel like nothing is being produced. They get a tangible idea of the process.
- Project is larger and collaboration more important.
- Highly useful when needing to break things into sprints (like this project)  
In conclusion: Agile is more practical for real-world software products where requirements might constantly change and flexibility is very important.
